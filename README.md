## Getting Started ##

Click [here](./documentation/getting_started.md) to see how to set up DeepHyperion and validate its general functionality.

## Detailed Description ##

Click [here](./documentation/details.md) to see how to validate the paperâ€™s claims and results in detail. This section introduces also extra use case scenarios to suggest how to extend the code beyond the scope of the paper.

## Repository Structure ##
The package is structured as follows:

* [__DeepHyperion-MNIST__](./DeepHyperion-MNIST) contains the DeepHyperion tool adapted to the handwritten digit classification case study and the instructions on how to use it;
* [__DeepHyperion-BNG__](./DeepHyperion-BNG) contains the DeepHyperion tool adapted to the self-driving car case study and the instructions on how to use it;
* [__experiments__](./experiments) contains the raw experimental data and the scripts to obtain the results reported in the paper;
* [__documentation__](./documentation) contains a quick installation guide and a detailed description of the tool.
* [__preprint__](./preprint.pdf) is the preprint version of our paper describing DeepHyperion.

_Note:_ each sub-package contains further specific instructions.
