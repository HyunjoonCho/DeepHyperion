## General Information ##
This repository contains the tools and the data of the paper "DeepHyperion: Exploring the Feature Space of Deep Learning-Based
Systems through Illumination Search"
 by T. Zohdinasab, V. Riccio, A. Gambi and P. Tonella, to be published in the Proceedings of the The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2021).

## Repository Structure ##
The package is structured as follows:

* [__DeepHyperion-MNIST__](/DeepHyperion-MNIST) contains the DeepHyperion tool adapted to the handwritten digit classification case study and the instructions on how to use it;
* [__DeepHyperion-BNG__](/DeepHyperion-BNG) contains the DeepHyperion tool adapted to the self-driving car case study and the instructions on how to use it;
* [__experiments__](/experiments) contains the raw experimental data reported in the paper and the scripts to obtain the data.

_Note:_ each sub-package contains further specific instructions.
